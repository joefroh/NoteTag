A note taking program that will reflow your notes after a class based on free form tagging

e.g.

<def> Puzzle: a type of thing people solve</def>
<code> cout<<endl </code>

this would allow people who are just typing their notes to mark them up and organize them
I have weird ideas when i dont want to be studying.

May 7:
Decided to explore prototype using implicit data end, meaning that a tag ends when a new tag is read

e.g.

<def> Puzzle: a type of thing people solve
<date> May 7th 2013 - the day i decided to use implicit tags
