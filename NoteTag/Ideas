A note taking program that will reflow your notes after a class based on free form tagging

e.g.

<def> Puzzle: a type of thing people solve</def>
<code> cout<<endl </code>

this would allow people who are just typing their notes to mark them up and organize them
I have weird ideas when i dont want to be studying.
